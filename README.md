### This project is not meant to be functional on other machines.
### Some of the source code is exposed here for you to peruse to get an idea of how the game works and how I code but it is not necessarily up-to-date or all I have used in this project.
### If you do decide to download the project instead of just a demo, I would be happy to answer any questions and/or help you get it up and running.
### Temporary assets in the exposed sections are provided for free by EpicGames (License at the bottom of this ReadMe), all other code/assets are created and provided for free by me under the MIT License.

Game Assets: Licensed for use with the Unreal Engine only. Without a custom license you cannot use to create sequels, remasters, or otherwise emulate the original game or use the original gameâ€™s trademarks, character names, or other IP to advertise or name your game. (Unreal Engine EULA applies) (Please note this applies to the Game Assets that refer to Epic's Paragon, you can still use the project code and content to build your own Unreal Engine game)
